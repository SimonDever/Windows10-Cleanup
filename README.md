# Windows10-Cleanup
This is a script to harden Windows 10 after initial installation and remove many of the default apps.

This was modified from a script by  Disassembler <disassembler@dasm.cz> that I found here:  http://pastebin.com/gQxCUkLP

I also incorporated some of the techniques and info found here:  https://github.com/W4RH4WK/Debloat-Windows-10
